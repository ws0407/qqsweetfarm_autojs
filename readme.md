## Notes

### 1. calculate one possible path



point of topleft land: (724.0, 796.0)
point of downright land: (1420.0, 652.0)

true point of topleft land: (807.0, 825.0)  diff: (+83, +29)
true point of downright land: (1420, 695)   diff: (+0, +43)

true point of downleft land: (983, 912)

slop: 153.5° or 26.5°
step size: ( (87.4, 43.4) + (88, 43.5) ) / 2 = (87.6, 43.5)
